    <h1>Now</h1>

    

    


    <p>I got married last year! Now we can move in together - as soon as
we wrap up some paperwork with the embassy, that is.</p>
<p>Nothing stands in the way of love,
given that the right forms are filled and delivered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work has been pretty hectic. The post-COVID market contraction hit
my industry pretty hard. There were a couple of layoffs and I&rsquo;ve got more
on my plate than ever. It&rsquo;s difficult for me to prioritize rest
sometimes.</li>
<li>I had a jam session with some friends from work. I
really miss playing guitar in a band.</li>
<li>On and off I&rsquo;m making a puzzle game in Godot. Godot is fun, though
I still need to get comfortable with GDScript.</li>
<li>Fitness is STILL a priority topic for me.
I managed to build exercise habits, but can&rsquo;t seem to stick to them during
trips or after I get sick. I got COVID a few times and it really broke
my streaks. I&rsquo;m starting walking for 30 - 45 minutes every day.</li>
<li>Started playing a D&amp;D campaign with some friends. Looking forward to the
next sesh.</li>
<li>Listening to the Dungeons &amp; Daddies podcast. It&rsquo;s hillarious.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on improving my sleep. I&rsquo;ve reduced
my coffeine intake, and adopted a few methods to reduce my screen time
with mixed results.</li>
</ul>
