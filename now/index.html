    <h1>Now</h1>

    

    


    <p>It&rsquo;s been 2 years since I moved to Berlin. The distance,
new environment and circumstance changed me. Each time
I visit home, I am washed by a torrent of emotions. Joy,
nostalgia and sadness in the same time. Happy and nostalgic
because I get to see the wonderful people that have been
a part of my life for most of it. Sad, because I am reminded
of the reasons why leaving was a good idea.</p>
<p>Here, sometimes I feel alone. I&rsquo;ve moved at the height
of the COVID pandemic, just when Germany went into
hard lockdown. It was months until things started returning to
normal, and I&rsquo;m still mostly working from home.</p>
<p>Even though I am still looking for my place here,
I have settled in and consider this home.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>My health and well-being. My exercise goals are more humble
now, but I hope I can maintain them for longer.</li>
<li>Posting more online.</li>
<li>Music production. I have recently acquired an Ableton Push 2,
and am having a great time with it.</li>
<li>Reading more. I&rsquo;m taking a more holistic approach, with trying
to read more books in parallel. Previously I found myself
binging books in a series and just burning out. Now I want
to take things easy and enjoy it more.</li>
</ul>
