    <h1>Now</h1>

    

    


    <p>The pandemic has made the world a scarier place.
As the measures transitioned from extreme to completely lax,
so too did I reemerge from my room. The first sights of &ldquo;outside&rdquo; felt quaint and
strangely nostalgic - as if I have returned from a long and taxing journey,
and everything was just slightly, but unsettlingly different.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving to Berlin for a new career opportunity.</li>
<li>Exercising three times a week and being mindful of my diet.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m doing the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine">r/bodyweight Recommended Routine</a>. I find it sophisticated and clear enough
to suit most peoples needs, and it certainly works for me.</li>
<li>I log my food and calorie intake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meditating every day.</li>
<li>Composing music.</li>
<li>Reading every day.
<ul>
<li>My goal is to read at least 24 books until the end of the year.
I&rsquo;m slightly behind schedule
due to taking a break, so I&rsquo;m trying to make up for that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting this site off the ground.</li>
</ul>
